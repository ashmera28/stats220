# Hello Everyone!
Welcome to my Website!

## About Me
*I'm a third year uni student majoring in Information Technology and Management.* **I'm a foodie, I love sketching and travelling as well.**

## I also am fond of memes :)
Below is a meme that I made using R package in R studio [{magick}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html).

A short summary of my inspiration for the meme is that I am an Army(BTS stan), I thought why not make a meme with BTS because I have watched
a lot of their videos and it's always hilarious. I found a picture that shows them basically being goofy and thought why not make it into a meme.
